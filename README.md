## Company’s background

HealthCare Provider, a beloved community health centre, prided itself on compassionate care but struggled to keep pace with modern demands. Recognizing the need for sustainability, they brought in a Data Analyst to assess their operations—not to increase profits, but to ensure they could continue serving their patients for years to come. Through careful analysis, the Data Analyst identified inefficiencies in scheduling, resource allocation, and patient care pathways. By refining these areas, the clinic improved patient outcomes and staff well-being, securing its future as a trusted community resource. Sunnybrook's mission of care-first healthcare was preserved, now with a stronger foundation.

## Project kick-off
Before starting the project, it’s crucial to have a clear understanding of the objectives and expectations. Consider the following questions:

- What is the primary goal of developing this Power BI dashboard for hospital analysis?
- How will the effectiveness and impact of this dashboard be evaluated?
- What is the project timeline, and when is the dashboard expected to be completed?
- Do stakeholders require an initial preview or prototype before the final dashboard is delivered?
- What are the key expectations and concerns of the stakeholders regarding this hospital analysis dashboard?
- Who are the intended users of this dashboard, and what specific insights or decisions will it support?
- What outcomes do stakeholders anticipate once the project is completed?
- What challenges or obstacles might the project team encounter during the development of this dashboard?
- What data sources and resources are necessary for building this hospital analysis dashboard?
- Have stakeholders provided any specific preferences or requirements for the design and layout of the dashboard?
  
Following the project kick-off meetings, the data engineering team will provide the necessary data. The next step is to explore the dataset.

## Importing Data into PowerBI

- The dataset is stored in an Excel sheet. To import the data into Power BI, provide the necessary database access credentials.

## Data Model

- Data modeling is critical and serves as the foundation of the report. The visuals are built upon the data model.
- Poor data modeling can negatively impact the report's performance.
- Follow best practices for data modeling. Refer to this blog for more information. [Blog](https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices/)
- This project follows the Snowflake data modeling method.
